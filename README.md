NTERNSHIP BY ELEVATE LABS I HAVE CHOOSEN THE DATASET OF CUSTOMER PERSONALITY ANALYSIS. I CHOOSE THIS DATASET BECAUSE IT HAS Null values and mixed data types Real-world customer data from a marketing campaign Categorical columns like Gender, Education, Marital Status Numerical values like Income, Spending.
It is Ideal for Practicing missing value handling, text standardization, and data type correction. 
Iâ€™ve enhanced your Excel dataset with the following upgrades: Added Columns: Customer_Age 
Total_Children 
Total_Spent Loyalty_Days (days since customer joined) 
Campaign_Acceptance_Score Cleaned: Filled missing Income values with the median Converted Dt_Customer to actual date format. 
I have removed duplicates and there's no blank coloumn in the data set. Then I have convert the data into Pivot Table which simpify and includes columns likes Includes columns like: 
Education 
Marital_Status 
Age_Group 
Total_Spent 
Customer_Age 
Loyalty_Days
Campaign_Acceptance_Score 
Total_Children
And at last theres a nar chart we give the information that the total amount spent by people, categorized by their marital status and education level. It reveals that Married Graduates spend the most, followed by those who are Together or Single with Graduate degrees. In general, higher education levels and being Married or in a relationship are linked to higher spending. Some unusual entries like "YOLO" may indicate data quality issues.
